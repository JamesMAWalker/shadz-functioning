        `for round faces is to find a frame
         with sharper angles and hard straight lines to contrast and balance
         the softer lines of this shape.`,
        `However, this suggestion assumes that facial features on a rounded
         face will also be round and soft in character, when this is very
         often not the case. Rounded faces can have have straight browlines,
         straight and sharp noses, and even angular laugh lines. If this is
         you, then look for a something in the cat-eye family. These frames
         are typically angular towards the edges, and more rounded in the
         center of the design. This will help to give contrast to the outline
         of your face, while also setting off your sharper feature shapes.`,
        `The last element to consider here is how the rest of your look can
         complement your frame choice, and even open up more possibilities
         for your particular face shape.`,

        When pairing sunglasses, it is best to follow the common wisdom and choose something rounded and curved - softer facial features typically won’t offset the strong angles of the square shape. However, it’s also important to consider color - a rounded frame in a shade similar to the skin tone will blend rather than contrast the hard lines.
        With more distinct shapes, it’s also important to know what to avoid. For strong shapes like a square jaw, stay away from flat top and sharper cat eye designs, as they can overemphasize these features, or even make them seem out of place by creating awkward angles. `,
